# MongoDB-Bot

A [Discord](https://discord.com/) bot built with [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/) and powered by [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) for persistent storage. This bot features modular commands, user data tracking, and server-specific settings. It was developed as an extension of earlier bots, introducing a database layer to support more advanced features.
